            <p>Whisky Company was deployed on from orbit on Ligar for one simple reason, head hunting. They were the final fell swoop in a trap in which they completely encircled a clan vanguard force.</p>

            <p>A star from Jade Falcon, assigned to act as artillery for the vanguard force into Ligar. They were generally unprotected, as the clans were utterly confident that the Fedcom forcers were in a full rout, and they wished to maximize damage by deploying all combat capable unit.</p>

            <p>Clan Jade Falcon was utterly prepared for the ambush. They were hit from behind by a heavy FEDCOM force. They never stood a chance, reinforcements was 15 minutes out, and they didn't even make it 5. It would have been called a shameful defeat if there was anyone left around to feel the shame.</p>
